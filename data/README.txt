ShapeWorld data can be downloaded at

http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jda/data/shapeworld.tar.gz

The archive is about 600M and expands to about 7G. You should place the
extracted folder in this directory. It contains both raw input image arrays and
precomputed ConvNet features.

I'm still figuring out how to distribute the navigation data; if you need it now
feel free to email me at jda@cs.berkeley.edu.
